We made a physical prototype od the reap and decided it will move along with two underlying "doodads" kind pf like a shelf.
We know the shelf will have to eventually be fastened to the doodads, otherwise it will slide off.
No matter our solution to the slide-off problem, we need to create doodads that move up and down along with player input.
