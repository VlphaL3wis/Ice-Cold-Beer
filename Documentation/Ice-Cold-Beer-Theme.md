# Game Idea
My game Idea for Ice Cold Beer is that you are an explore trying to escape a Jungle.
## The Ball 
- An explorer who is trying to escape out of a jungle https://www.dropbox.com/s/niq34tj4x4vdowr/GIF.gif?raw=1
## The Background and walls
- The background is preetty dark with lots of trees and dirt https://itch.io/queue/c/287302/assets-for-games?game_id=229492 or https://finalbossblues.itch.io/tf-jungle-tileset
 ## The ramp 
- Is a number of different ramps that help you escape upwards to exit the cave https://opengameart.org/sites/default/files/simples_pimples_preview.png
## The Holes
- The holes represent animals and monsters trying to eat the explore
