# Brainstorm
1. Player can use analog sticks on gamepad to emulate arcade joysticks.
2. We want to come up with a mouse and keyboard control scheme for players without gamepads!
3. Could work as a mobile game? What would the controls?
4. How can I customize the theme? My game is not going about Ice Cold Beer
5. David wants us to have playable prototype as top priority!
